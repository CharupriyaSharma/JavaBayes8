# JavaBayes8
JavaBayes is a system that handles Bayesian networks: it calculates marginal probabilities and expectations, produces explanations, performs robustness analysis, and allows the user to import, create, modify and export networks.

This version of [JavaBayes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes/Home/) modified to compile in Java 8 and adding capabilities for batch inference queries on Bayesian Networks in place of the original GUI.
